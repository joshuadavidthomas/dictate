Pattern: store generation when starting animation, check generation when handling completion.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-13T19:36:39.795626834-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T21:28:14.92831812-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-13T21:28:14.92831812-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"dictate-tyt","depends_on_id":"dictate-auq","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-13T19:38:08.642513395-06:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"dictate-tyt","depends_on_id":"dictate-gr0","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-13T19:38:17.280660042-06:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
